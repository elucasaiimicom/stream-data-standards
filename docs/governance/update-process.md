# Updating process for Stream data standards

The update process for Stream data standards was agreed by all participants at the third Stream Data Standards Workstream meeting on 15th January 2024.

## Changes provided via Pull Requests (PR)

It was agreed that changes would be suggested using the [GitHub Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) tooling. 

PRs are used in a GitHub repository to suggest changes for the content within that repository.

A PR will be created for every change once the Data Standards are agreed.

## Allowing changes from outside Stream

It was agreed that the repository would allow for PRs to be created from external repositories.

This decision provides for organisations and people external to Stream who want to suggest changes to be able to do so.

## Adapt and adopt the GOV.UK "Merge a Pull Request" process

It was agreed that Stream would adapt and adopt the "Merge a Pull Request" process outlined at [https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/merge-pr.html](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/merge-pr.html).

### Stream process for merging a pull request

1. The main branch must be able to be released at any time.
2. The change must have at least 1 review from repository administrators. The author is expected under most circumstances not to accept their own PR.
3. If there are any changes needed for a request, the request should be rejected and a new request with the changes made.
4. The GitHub review UI should be used to discuss changes, mark a PR as approved or requiring changes.
5. The GitHub UI should be used to merge the PR.

## Repository administrators

It was agreed that the Stream Advisory Group responsible for technology would have the authority to name and manage those who are responsible for managing Pull Requests and repository administration.

The repository administrators will be agreed by the Advisory Group, and will have the technical expertise and/or water industry knowledge to be able to understand and accept change requests.
