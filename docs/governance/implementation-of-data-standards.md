# Implementation of data standards

The implementation support documents that are needed for Stream data standards were agreed by all participants at the third Stream Data Standards Workstream meeting on 15th January 2024.

It was agreed that the list of standards that can be used and a glossary will be maintained within the Stream data standards.

It was agreed that we should provide standard requirements for documentation of both Stream overall and each dataset published by Stream including (non-exhaustive list):

* What standards are being used for each dataset
* How any standards specific are to be used
  * This includes standards for publishing data into Stream
  * And standards for datasets published into Stream

It was agreed that it is important to provide documentation on how publishers and consumers of Stream data should implement the data standards.
