# Approval process for Stream data standards

It was agreed by all participants at the second Stream Data Standards Workstream meeting on 11th December 2023 that the process for approving Stream data standards would be:

1. Any changes to the Stream data standards need to be either accepted or rejected by a team given the responsibility to do so by Stream. See [Update Process](update-process.md) for further information.
2. All changes that are accepted in step 1 are then presented to the Stream Advisory Group responsible for the purpose of acceptance by Stream for possible adoption.
3. If approval is given in step 2, these same changes are then presented to the Stream Steering Group for the purposes of adoption as the new Stream data standards.
4. If the Steering Group accepts the changes in step 3, then the current Stream data standards are updated to include the adopted changes.

This process follows the governance procedure in place across all of Stream.

The names of the Steering Group and the Advisory Groups may change over time. It is expected that this will only require a name change for this process e.g. Steering Group to Steering Committee.
