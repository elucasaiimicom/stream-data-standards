# Document repository for Stream data standards

This document repository contains the in progress documentation for the Stream data standards.

It was agreed by all participants at the first Stream Data Standards Workstream meeting on 30th November 2023 that the documentation would initially be stored in a git repository on GitHub.

It was also agreed at the same meeting that this repository is only the initial location and may be moved at a later date, after the governance processes are agreed.
