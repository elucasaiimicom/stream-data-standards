# Problem statement for the Stream data standards

## Audit

* v 1.0
  * Date: 2023-11-30
  * Approved at: Workstream Meeting 1

## Problem statement

The problem that the Stream data standards workstream is trying to solve is:

> **"Organisations that will use data published through Stream (Data Consumers) or provide data to Stream (Data Publishers) do not have key information about the published data (metadata), formats accepted, documentation, processes, and shared reference data, and as such find it hard to engage with Stream to both consume and publish data."**

This problem statement was agreed by all participants at the first Stream Data Standards Workstream meeting on 30th November 2023, alongside discussion of the challenges that the data standards workstream is trying to solve.

## Context - challenges for data standards workstream

Several challenges were identified that fed into the problem statement:

* Data schemas are inconsistent across water companies
* Water companies do not know what formats are acceptable for current and new datasets
* There are currently no known minimum requirements around metadata and documentation for published datasets
* There is no defined process for how we create consensus for data standards
* No shared understanding of what data standards *are*
