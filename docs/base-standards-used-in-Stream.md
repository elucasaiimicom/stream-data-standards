# Base standards used in Stream

The base standards for Stream data standards were agreed by all participants at the third Stream Data Standards Workstream meeting on 15th January 2024.

It was agreed that we would adapt the [Open standards for government data and technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-standards-for-government-data-and-technology) for the base (foundational) standards in use by Stream.

It was agreed that as part of the Stream data standards, we should provide justification for including, and where relevant, excluding various standards for use with Stream.

It was agreed that we would create a data standards glossary for Stream data standards to ensure that the terminology we are using is clear and consistent.

It was agreed that the initial data standards we need to document and add to the base data standards are:

* Data standards for use with CSV datasets
  * The CSV format is described in [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180)
* Data standards for use with Shapefile format datasets
  * The Shapefile format is described on the ESRI website in the [ESRI Shapefile Technical Description](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/sitecore-archive/Files/Pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf) PDF document
* Data standards for other geographical datasets
  * A recommendation for which standard Stream will adopt for geographical data will be made shortly.
