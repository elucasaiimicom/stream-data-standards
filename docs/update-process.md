# Updating process for Stream data standards

The update process for Stream data standards was agreed by all participants at the third Stream Data Standards Workstream meeting on 15th January 2024.

## Changes provided via Pull Requests (PR)

It was agreed that changes would be suggested using the [GitHub Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) tooling. 

PRs are used in a GitHub repository to suggest changes for the content within that repository.

A PR will be created for every change once the Data Standards are agreed.

## Allowing changes from outside Stream

It was agreed that the repository would allow for PRs to be created from external repositories.

This decision provides for organisations and people external to Stream who want to suggest changes to be able to do so.

## Adapt and adopt the GOV.UK "Merge a Pull Request" process

It was agreed that Stream would adapt and adopt the "Merge a Pull Request" process outlined at [https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/merge-pr.html](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/merge-pr.html).

This process is already documented and provides a good starting point to build upon.

## Repository administrators

It was agreed that we would request that the Stream Advisory Group responsible for technology would have the responsibility for managing who has responsibility for managing the Pull Requests and the repository administration.
